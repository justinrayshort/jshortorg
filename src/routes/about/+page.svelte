		You may wonder who I am and what I do<br />
		But I won't tell you much, that's up to you<br />
		You can guess from my website what I like and what I know<br />
		But there are many things about me that I won't show<br />
		<br />
		I could have written a great about me section<br />
		But that would be too easy and lack some direction<br />
		So instead I'll write some rhymes that may make you grin or chuckle<br />
		And maybe you'll learn something about me in the shuffle<br />
		<br />
		Here are some facts about me that may or may not be true<br />
		Some are weird, some are funny, some are old, some are new<br />
		You can try to figure out which ones are real and which ones are fake<br />
		But don't take them too seriously, they're just for fun's sake<br />
		<br />
		I once won a Nobel Prize for literature, but I gave it back because I didnâ€™t like the color of the

		I have a pet unicorn named Sparkles who can fly and shoot rainbows from his horn.<br />
		<br />
		I can speak 27 languages fluently, including Klingon, Elvish, and Dothraki.<br />
		<br />
		I am a secret agent who works for a mysterious organization that saves the world from evil villains.<br
		/>
		<br />
		I have a PhD in astrophysics, but I also moonlight as a rock star.<br />
		<br />
		I am allergic to water, so I only drink soda and juice.<br />
		<br />
		I have a tattoo of a dragon on my back that comes to life when Iâ€™m angry.<br />
		<br />
		I am the worldâ€™s best chess player, but I only play online under a pseudonym.<br />
		<br />
		I have a twin brother who looks exactly like me, but he is evil and tries to ruin my life.<br />
		<br />
		I have traveled to every country in the world, except for Antarctica, because itâ€™s too cold.<br
		/>
		<br />
		I have a collection of rare and exotic plants that can sing and dance.<br />
		<br />
		I have a superpower that allows me to read minds, but only when people are thinking about pizza.<br
		/>
		<br />
		I have a time machine that I use to visit different historical periods and meet famous people.<br
		/>
		<br />
		I have a secret crush on a famous celebrity, but I wonâ€™t tell you who it is.<br />
		<br />
		I have a hidden talent for painting, but I only paint with my feet.<br />
		<br />
		I have a fear of clowns, so I avoid circuses and birthday parties.<br />
		<br />
		I have a hobby of knitting, but I only knit sweaters for penguins.<br />
		<br />
		I have a dream of becoming an astronaut, but Iâ€™m afraid of heights.<br />
		<br />
		I have a passion for cooking, but I only cook spicy food that makes people cry.<br />
		<br />
		I have a friend who is a vampire, but he doesnâ€™t bite me because he likes garlic.<br />
